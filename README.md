## Usage

### How to add commands

As I said before, this code is using the [wokcommands](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wokcommands) package so to create a command, go to the "commands" folder and inside there you can create all you commands with the following structure:

```js
module.exports = {
    ownerOnly: true, // Owner only command (Boolean) - Optional
    guildOnly: true, // Guild only command (Boolean) - Optional
    testOnly: true, // Test servers only command (Boolean) - Optional

    name: 'ping', // Name of the command (String)- Optional
    commands: ['runping'], // Execute name of the command (String/Array)- Optional
    aliases: ['p'], // Aliases of the command (String/Array) - Optional
    description: 'Replies with pong', // Description of the command (String)

    requiredPermissions: ['ADMINISTRATOR'], // User's required permissions to run the command (Array) - Optional
    cooldown: '5s', // Per user cooldown of the command (s-seconds m-minutes h-hours) - Optional
    //globalCooldown: '60s', // Per server cooldown of the command (minimum 60s) - Optional
    category: 'Misc', // Category of the command (String)

    minArgs: 0, // Minimun arguments of the command - Optional
    maxArgs: 0, // Maxmimum arguments of the command (Infinite  = -1) - Optional
    
    syntaxError: 'Incorrect syntax! Use `{PREFIX}ping`', // Syntax Error of the command - Optional
    expectedArgs: "<Target user's @>", //Expected arguments of the command - Optional (reccommended)
    
    callback: async ({  message, args, text, client, prefix, instance }) => {
      message.reply('pong')
    }
  }
```
Read the [wokcommands](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wokcommands) full documentation for more detailed information.

### How to add features

You need to go to the "features" folder and inside that folder you can create all of your events following the structure:
```js
module.exports = (client, instance) => {
  console.log('Hello world!')
}

module.exports.config = { // Optional
  displayName: 'Test', // Can be changed any time
  dbName: 'TEST', // Should be unique and NEVER be changed once set
  loadDBFirst: true, // Wait for the database connection to be present
}
```

### How to add a Test Server

Copy your discord test server id and go to the index.js file and paste that id on the `testServers: [''],` brackets.

```js 
new WOKCommands(client, {
    commandsDir: 'commands',
    featureDir: 'features',
    messagesPath: 'messages.json',
    showWarns: true,
